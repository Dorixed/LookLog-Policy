**Privacy Policy**

This privacy policy applies to the LookLog application (hereinafter referred to as "the application") created by Deng Xian (hereinafter referred to as "the service provider"). This application focuses on privacy protection and does not collect any user information. This service is provided on an "as is" basis.

**Information Collection and Use**

This application strictly adheres to privacy protection principles:

* Does not collect any personal identification information
* Does not collect device information
* Does not collect location information
* Does not collect usage data
* All data is stored locally on the user's device
* Will not transfer data to any third party

**Third-Party Access**

This application does not share data with any third parties because we do not collect any user data at all.

**Data Storage**

All application data is strictly stored locally on the user's device, and the service provider cannot access this data.

**Children**

The service provider does not intentionally solicit data from children under the age of 13 through the application or market to them.

The service provider does not intentionally collect personal identification information from children. The service provider encourages all children not to submit any personal identification information through the application. The service provider encourages parents and legal guardians to supervise their children's internet usage and to help enforce this policy by instructing their children not to provide personal identification information through the application without permission. If you have reason to believe that a child has provided personal identification information to the service provider through the application, please contact the service provider (dengxian0714@gmail.com) so that necessary measures can be taken. You must also be at least 16 years old to consent to the processing of your personal identification information in your country/region (in some countries/regions, we may allow your parents or guardians to do this on your behalf).

**Security**

Since all data is stored locally on the user's device and the application does not collect any user information, your privacy is maximally protected.

**Changes**

This privacy policy may be updated from time to time. The service provider will notify you of any changes by updating the new privacy policy on this page.

This privacy policy is effective from November 15, 2024.
