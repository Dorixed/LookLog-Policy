# Terms of Service

These Terms of Service apply to the LookLog application (hereinafter referred to as "the application") created by Deng Xian (hereinafter referred to as "the service provider"), which is a free-to-use mobile application.

By downloading or using this application, you automatically agree to the following terms. It is strongly recommended that you read and understand these terms carefully before using the application. Unauthorized copying, modification of the application, any part of the application, or our trademarks is strictly prohibited. Any attempts to extract the source code of the application, translate the application into other languages, or create derivative versions are forbidden. All trademarks, copyrights, database rights, and other intellectual property rights related to the application are the property of the service provider.

The service provider is committed to ensuring that the application is as beneficial and efficient as possible. Therefore, the service provider reserves the right to modify the application or charge for its services at any time for any reason. The service provider assures you that any fees related to the application or its services will be clearly communicated to you.

The application stores and processes the personal data you provide to the service provider in order to provide services. It is your responsibility to maintain the security of your phone and the access to the application. The service provider strongly advises against jailbreaking or rooting your phone, as these actions remove the software restrictions imposed by the official operating system. Such actions may expose your phone to malware, viruses, and malicious programs, compromise the security features of your phone, and may cause the application to malfunction or become completely unusable.

Please note that the service provider is not responsible for certain aspects. Some features of the application require an active internet connection, which can be Wi-Fi or provided by your mobile network provider. The service provider is not liable if the application cannot function fully due to lack of access to Wi-Fi or if your data allowance is exhausted.

If you use the application outside of a Wi-Fi area, please be aware that the terms of your mobile network provider still apply. Therefore, you may incur charges from your mobile provider or other third parties for data usage while using the application. By using the application, you accept responsibility for any such charges, including roaming data charges incurred while using the application outside of your local area (i.e., region or country) if data roaming is not disabled. If you are not the payer for the device using the application, it is assumed that you have obtained permission from the payer.

Similarly, the service provider cannot always be held responsible for your use of the application. For example, it is your responsibility to ensure that your device is adequately charged. The service provider is not liable if your device runs out of battery and you cannot access the service.

Regarding the service provider's liability for your use of the application, it is important to note that while they strive to keep the application updated and accurate, they do rely on third parties for information. The service provider is not liable for any direct or indirect losses you may suffer as a result of relying entirely on the application's functionality.

The service provider may update the application at some point. The application is currently provided according to the requirements of the operating system (and any other systems they decide to extend the application to), and these requirements may change. If you wish to continue using the application, you will need to download updates. The service provider does not guarantee that the application will always be updated to ensure its relevance and/or compatibility with the specific operating system version installed on your device. However, you agree to always accept application updates when prompted. The service provider may also wish to discontinue providing the application and may terminate its use at any time without notice to you. Unless otherwise notified, in the event of any termination, (a) the rights and licenses granted to you by these terms will terminate; (b) you must stop using the application and, if necessary, remove it from your device.

**Changes to the Terms of Service**

The service provider may periodically update its Terms of Service. Therefore, it is recommended that you regularly check this page for any changes. The service provider will notify you of any changes by posting the new Terms of Service on this page.

These Terms of Service are effective from November 15, 2024.
